# Team Member Images

## Required Images

Place your team member images in this directory with the following names:

- `member-one.jpg` - Project Lead
- `member-two.jpg` - ML Engineer
- `member-three.jpg` - Data Scientist
- `member-four.jpg` - Full Stack Developer

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Recommended Size**: 826 x 1239 pixels (portrait orientation)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 2:3 (portrait)
- **File Size**: Optimize to < 500KB for web performance

## Image Guidelines

1. Use high-quality, professional photos
2. Portrait orientation works best (vertical/taller than wide)
3. Subject should be centered and well-lit
4. Consistent style across all member photos recommended
5. The component applies grayscale by default, with color on hover

## Example Structure

```
team/
├── member-one.jpg
├── member-two.jpg
├── member-three.jpg
└── member-four.jpg
```

After adding images, update the member names and roles in `src/components/team.tsx`.
